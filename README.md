<p>Pokemon uses the <a href="https://pokeapi.co/">PokeApi</a> to get information from the server. The PokeApi has a lot of details about the main Pok√©mon games and offers them through a RESTful API. game series.</p>

<!-- Architecture -->
<h2>ArchitectureüèóÔ∏è </h2>
<p>Pokemon App uses the MVVM architecture to separate UI and Data components, ensuring a clear separation of concerns, driving the UI from data models, maintaining a single source of truth, and enforcing unidirectional data flow for a more maintainable and testable Android app.</p>

</p>

<h3>Architecture Overview</h3>
<p>By adapting architectural layering, the Pokemon App follows a unidirectional data flow, responding accordingly to user events and updating UI states.</p>

<h3>UI LayerüñºÔ∏è </h3>

</p>
<p>The UI layer serves as the primary point for user interactions and displays the application data. It should update whenever the app data changes, reflecting changes made by either user interaction or external input./p>
<ul>
  <li>Depending on user interactions, the main activity hosts the navigation controller and navigates through two screens: PokemonListScreen and PokemonDetailScreen. </li>
  <li>The PokemonListViewModel requests data from the data layer, and the PokemonListScreen updates its UI by observing the states managed by the ViewModel.</li>
  <li>The responsibility of the PokemonDetailViewModel is to fetch Pokemon details and update the states for the PokemonDetailScreen.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h3>Data Layerüëæ </h3>

</p>
<p>The data layer is responsible for containing application data and business logic. It consists of repositories and data sources. Keeping each repository as a single source of truth is crucial.</p>
<ul>
  <li>PokemonRepository requests data from the remote data source and serves as a single source of truth.</li>
  <li>PokemonRepository uses the Retrofit library to send requests to the PokeAPI server and retrieve network responses.</li>
</ul>
